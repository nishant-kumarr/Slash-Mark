# Slash-Mark IT Startup Projects Repository

Welcome to the repository that holds all the project files I worked on during my internship at Slash Mark IT Startup. Each project is organized in its own sub-folder for easy navigation. Below is an overview of each project along with some instructions on how to explore them.

## Project 1 : Text Encryption Using Cryptographic Algorithms
**Description :**  
This project involves the development of a simple web application that can encrypt and decrypt textual information entered by the user. The encryption process is robust, producing different outputs even when given the same input, ensuring the security and integrity of the data.

### Highlights:
- **Folder :** `Text_Encryption-Decryption`
- **ReadMe :** Detailed overview and usage instructions in its `readme` file.
- **Demo :** Watch the `Demo video` to see the project in action, available in its sub-folder.
- **Code Explanation :** Refer to the `explainer file` for a detailed explanation of the code blocks.

## Project 2 : Keylogger Software
**Description :**  
This software records every keystroke made by the user on their keyboard and mouse. It is a good cybersecurity project and can be used as a critical tool for monitoring and analyzing user behavior for security purposes.

### Highlights:
- **Folder :** `Keylogger`
- **ReadMe :** Detailed overview and usage instructions in its `readme` file.
- **Demo :** Watch the `Demo` video to see the project in action.
- **Code Explanation:** Refer to the `Explainer file` for a detailed explanation of the code blocks.

## Project 3: Image Encryption
**Description :**  
This project focuses on developing an image encryption software that shuffles pixels using cryptographic keys. The encryption is so secure that even with internet access to the images, they cannot be decrypted without the appropriate key. This project explores the basics of cybersecurity and enhances cryptography skills.

### Highlights:
- **Folder :** `Image_Encryption`
- **ReadMe :** Detailed overview and usage instructions in its `readme` file.
- **Demo :** Watch the `Demo` video to see the project in action.
- **Code Explanation :** Refer to the `Explainer file` for a detailed explanation of the code blocks.
